# diff-api
This API provides HTTP endpoints that accepts JSON base64 encoded binary data on both, as it follows:

* <b>List all messages created:</b> `<host>/`
	 
* <b>List all left messages created:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/left/all`
	 
* <b>List all right messages created:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/right/all`
	 
* <b>Decode some JSON base64 string on the left endpoint:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/{id}/left/decodeString`
	 
* <b>Decode some JSON base64 string on the right endpoint:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/{id}/right/decodeString`

* <b>Create a message on the left endpoint:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/<ID>/left`
        
* <b>Create a message on the right endpoint:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/<ID>/right`

* <b>The provided data is diff-ed and the results are available on a third end point:</b> `<host>/v1/diff/<ID>`


<b>The results are provided in JSON format as following:</b>

    If equal return that
    If not of equal size just return that
    If of same size provide insight in where the diffs are, actual diffs are not needed.
        ยง So mainly offsets + length in the data

It will clean, compile and generate a jar at target directory, e.g. `diff-api-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

### Test

It provides some methods to test:

โข Unit and Integration Tests

For both, you can run:

    mvn test

Just for Unit Tests:

    mvn -Dtest=DiffApiApplicationUnitTests test

Just for Integration Tests, run:

    mvn -Dtest=DiffApiApplicationIntegrationTests test
    
### Run

In order to run the web service, run the uber jar simply as following:

    java -jar diff-api-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

By default, the service will be available at
